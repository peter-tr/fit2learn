## Overview

Are you struggling to learn how to exercise? Are you exhausted from researching through the web and social media, trying to find a reliable and easy-to-use source of fitness and nutrition information? Look no further. **Fit2Learn** is an intuitive and engaging fitness-based educational website designed to help beginners and fitness enthusiasts alike.

Many beginners are anxious about starting their fitness journey and often lean towards expensive gym programs or low-quality YouTube videos that can cause more harm than benefit. Fit2Learn aims to solve this issue by enabling users to form communities of like-minded individuals committed to living their best lives.

## Objectives

Fit2Learn is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which allows for easier maintenance and testing by separating application components. The website provides a platform for content creators and instructors to upload their own courses, which learners can view, purchase, and download. The courses are highly customizable, allowing creators to add tags, descriptions, and other engaging content.

### Key Features:

- **Course Creation and Customization:** Content creators can upload courses, customize them with tags and descriptions, and generate closed captions via voice recognition for enhanced learnability.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can easily find courses of interest using the built-in search functionality.
- **User Profiles:** Users can create and personalize profiles to track their fitness goals and favorite workouts.
- **Social Features:** Users can like, rate, comment on courses, subscribe to instructors, add courses to wishlists or collections, and share content with others.
- **Notifications:** A notification system alerts users when invoices are available for purchases or when their favorite instructors release new content.
- **Server-Side Validation:** Fit2Learn includes server-side login validation, registration, and user profile management.
- **Real-Time Form Validation:** AJAX is used for real-time form validation and continuous scrolling.
- **Security:** The site features multi-factor authentication (MFA), password policies, email verification, hashed passwords, and encrypted payment details to protect users.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** The foundation of the website's user interface.
- **Bootstrap:** Used for responsive and mobile-first design.
- **jQuery:** Simplifies JavaScript programming with easy-to-use functions and effects.

### Back-End:
- **PHP & CodeIgniter:** The website is powered by the CodeIgniter PHP framework, which follows the MVC architecture.
- **MySQL:** A relational database to store all content and data.

### Deployment:
- **Google Cloud Plaforms :** The website is deployed on Google Cloud Platforms.

## UI/UX Design

Fit2Learn follows standard website design patterns for intuitiveness and ease of use. Conventional icons, such as the ‘hamburger’ icon for expanding menus and the ‘magnifying glass’ for search, are used throughout the site. All core pages and functionality are accessible from the top navigation bar, with additional options available via dropdown menus.
